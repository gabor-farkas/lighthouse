# Lighthouse

A mini smart switch hobby project that adds a wifi controlled white led behind this IKEA picture on the wall:

It uses
* A Wemos D1 mini with the program here
* Some resistor
* a 2x1.5 battery box
* It also features my home WiFi password, so if you know where I live, come and take some internet :)
